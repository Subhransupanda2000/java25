Basic Questions:
What are the stages in the lifecycle of a servlet?
What is the purpose of the init() method in the servlet lifecycle?
What happens during the service() method execution?
Explain the role of the destroy() method. When is it called?
How does the servlet container handle servlet instantiation?
Can you explain the difference between doGet() and doPost() methods in servlets?
What happens if the init() method throws an exception?
Intermediate Questions:
Can you describe the lifecycle methods in detail?
How can you ensure thread safety in the service() method?
What is the default behavior of the init() method in GenericServlet?
When and why is the ServletConfig object used during the servlet lifecycle?
How is the servlet destroyed if the server crashes unexpectedly?
What is the difference between a servlet being unloaded and destroyed?
How does the servlet lifecycle relate to the HTTP request-response model?
Advanced Questions:
What is lazy loading of servlets, and how does it impact the servlet lifecycle?
How can you configure the load-on-startup behavior for servlets?
What is the role of the ServletContext in the lifecycle of a servlet?
How can you simulate or test the destroy() method of a servlet?
What are the lifecycle implications of using single-threaded servlets (SingleThreadModel)?
Can you override the lifecycle methods in HttpServlet? If yes, what are the implications?
Scenario-Based Questions:
What happens if a servlet is accessed before it is initialized?
If the service() method contains resource-heavy operations, how would you optimize its behavior?
How does the servlet container manage multiple requests to the same servlet?
If a servlet is reloaded or redeployed, what happens to the old instance?
What would you do if the servlet lifecycle methods are not being executed as expected?
Tips for Answering:
Focus on conceptual clarity about the servlet lifecycle stages: instantiation, initialization, request handling, and destruction.
Provide examples where possible, such as init() is used to establish a database connection, service() processes incoming requests, and destroy() cleans up resources.
Highlight best practices, like ensuring thread safety and proper resource cleanup.
